# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.
#
# Note that the row index starts from 0.
#
# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
# Follow up:
#
# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
